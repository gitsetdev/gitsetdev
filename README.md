### Layer Descriptions

#### Frontend Layer
- **Entry Point:** Built with Astro SSR and React.js, it manages user interactions, content rendering, and communication with other services.

#### Authentication System
- **Authentication Gateway**: 
  - Functions as the security checkpoint, routing requests based on the authentication status of users.
  - Enforces access control policies and ensures secure request handling by interfacing with the authentication service.

- **Authentication Service**: 
  - Utilizes Drizzle ORM for database interaction, providing persistent storage for user data.
  - Integrates GitHub OAuth for user authentication, managing session tokens and ensuring secure user identification.
  - The session manager is responsible for managing the lifecycle of user sessions.

#### CLI Processing Layer
- **GitSet CLI:** Is an integral component of the GitSet.dev ecosystem, designed to enhance Git workflow automation through AI-driven commit message generation. By leveraging Google's Gemini Pro AI technology, it provides intelligent analysis of staged changes to generate contextually appropriate commit messages, supporting both semantic and personalized formatting styles.

#### Protected Services Layer
- **Core Services:** Includes README generation, commit message creation, version control, repository assessment, and code decommenting.

#### AI Processing Backend Layer

#### Payment Processing & Rate Limiting:

#### Lemon Squeezy Integration & Request Tracking
The payment system implements a tier-based access control mechanism that operates across multiple layers:

- **Payment Processing (Lemon Squeezy Layer):**
  - Handles subscription management and payment processing
  - Communicates plan changes via webhooks
  - Maintains billing and subscription data separately from usage tracking

- **Usage Tracking (Python Backends):**
  - Each Python backend maintains its own protected request counter.
  - Request tracking is isolated from payment data and OAuth authentication.
  - Counters are stored securely and independently of Drizzle ORM user data.
  - Rate limits are enforced per service:
    - Basic Plan (T1): Feature-specific limits.
    - Professional Plan (T2): Unlimited access.

- **Request Flow:**
  1. Backend validates request tier (`basic`/`pro`) via authentication token.
  2. Service-specific counter checks remaining quota.
  3. Request processed if quota allows.
  4. Counter updated atomically after successful processing.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Usage tracking is isolated from payment processing.
  - Authentication data (GitHub OAuth/Drizzle ORM) remains separate.
  - Each service maintains independent rate limiting.

### Technical Considerations
- **Scalability**: The system ensures horizontal scalability with independent scaling of AI processing units, as well as the distributed handling of public and protected service layers. Each layer can scale independently based on demand.
  
- **Security**: The authentication gateway serves as the primary security checkpoint, ensuring that only authenticated requests can access protected services. OAuth-based authentication ensures secure user identification and session management.
  
- **Performance**: The use of parallel AI processing, combined with a robust content aggregation system, ensures that the system can efficiently process and deliver content. The public and protected services are optimized for minimal latency.

- **Integration Points**: 
  - Integration with GitHub for authentication and API access.
  - Gemini AI services for advanced content generation and analysis.
  - Python backend (FastAPI and Flask): Handles template-based processing and AI-driven request handling and response delivery.
  - SSR frontend ensures dynamic rendering of content based on user interaction.
